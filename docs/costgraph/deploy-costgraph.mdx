# Deploy Costgraph

Get started on running Costgraph on your infrastructure.


## PreRequisites

### Helm 
This is an installation of the `helm` CLI. Check out the [tools installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Prometheus

If you do not have prometheus-server installed on your cluster, you can use the installation guide below:

- Add the chart to deploy prometheus on the cluster.
```shell
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

- Install the operator to begin collecting metrics for workloads on the cluster.
```shell
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace prometheus-system --create-namespace
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=10m -n prometheus-system deploy/prometheus-server
```


### Obtain an API Key

To run the costgraph operator, you must create an account on [costgraph.baselinehq.cloud](https://costgraph.baselinehq.cloud/) to obtain an API key.

import APIKeyImage from "@site/static/img/api-key.png"

<img src={APIKeyImage} alt="API Key Image"  />


### Setup a plan

Once you obtain an API key, setup a plan to allow the API key to have billing enabled.


:::warning[Setting up a plan]
You must have a plan setup for your organization to use the operator. Not doing so will cause the operator to fail on startup.

:::tip[Free Plan Available For Developers]

There's a free plan available on the `One-Time` tab to begin using Costgraph without any payment.

:::

### Helm configuration
In deploying the costgraph operator, the charts are available in the GitHub repository [costgraph-charts](https://github.com/BaselineHQ/costgraph-charts)

Run the helm command below to import the charts into the repository to begin deploying the operator.

```shell
helm repo add costgraph https://baselinehq.github.io/costgraph-charts/
helm repo update
```


## Configuration

### Costgraph
Create a configuration file with the helm updates that are required in deploying the package

```yaml
domain: <your-company-subdomain>
costgraph:
  config:
    costgraph_instance_name: <instance-name>
    expected_utilisation_percent: <expected-utilisation>
    prometheus_endpoint: <prometheus-address>
    api_key: <your-api-key>
```


:::tip[Using Multiple Cost Centers]


If you have an existing costgraph instance, you can configure replication to that cost center by appending the relevant cluster names to the  `costgraph_instance_master_domains` configuration.

You can append multiple clusters to the configuration, this will be the `costgraph_instance_name` of the instance you want to view costs from.

```yaml
costgraph:
  config:
    costgraph_instance_master_domains:
      - name: "<cluster-to-replicate-to>"
```

:::




### Superset
To configure the superset credentials, update the configuration for the superset setting.

```yaml
costgraph:
  config:
    superset_admin_username: admin
    superset_admin_password: admin
```

### Postgres

:::caution[Postgres Configuration]

Only use this if you have an existing postgres instance or manage a Postgres instance outside Kubernetes eg AWS Aurora etc.

:::


If you want to use an existing database instance, add in this configuration

```yaml
postgres:
  enabled: false
  config:
    postgres_db: postgres
    postgres_user: username
    postgres_password: password
    pg_data_directory: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    postgres_host: db_hostname
    postgres_port: db_port
```

## Deployment
Finally deploy the configuration with the updated settings for your costgraph instance 

```shell
helm install costgraph costgraph/costgraph -f <values-file>
```



## Accessing the dashboard

:::tip[Superset Credentials]

Unless modified, the username and password for the superset instance is `admin` and `admin`

:::

Once the deployment is complete, you can access the costgraph dashboard on the domain `costgraph.$domain` and login with the credentials provided in the configuration file.

:::note[Accessing the dashboard]

Ensure that the domain is accessible from the network you are connecting from. If you are using a local cluster, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command to access the dashboard.

```shell
python -m webbrowser -t http://localhost:8088
kubectl port-forward svc/superset 8088:80 -n costgraph
```
:::

## Prometheus

The operator comes pre-installed with a prometheus server allowing you to view metrics as available on the database in the prometheus dashboard.

:::note[Exposing Prmetheus Metrics]

You must have service auto-discovery enabled for kubernetes services to have the operator metrics scraped by the prometheus server.

> NOTE: If you installed prometheus-server using this guide, you have auto-discovery enabled by default for kubernetes services.

If you do not see any targets with `costgraph`, the scrape configuration will need to be manually added as a static target to your prometheus instance.

```yaml
-   job_name: 'costgraph'
    honor_labels: true
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 10s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scheme: http
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['costgraph.costgraph:9090']
```

:::

All metrics are prefixed with the `costgraph_` prefix and can be viewed for your usage in Grafana, Perses or your preferred dashboard tool.


import PrometheusImage from "@site/static/img/prometheus.png"

<img src={PrometheusImage} alt="API Key Image"  />


Once you have the operator running, you can install the Grafana dashboard to view the metrics in a more user-friendly format.
